# INDE577 @ Rice University Fall 2021

This repository is special for code assignments of course INDE577, Data Science and Machine Learning, of Rice University in Fall 2021. The course instructor is Dr. Randy R. Davila, Associate Professor of University of Houston-Downtown.

In this course, we are learning data science and machine learning algorithms and python-based applications. Course topics consist of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning (not sure).

For this repository, each sub-repository is named by an algorithm name, and it contains a .ipynb file which illustrates and impliments algorithms/applications/visualizations learned in that week, a README file, and sub-repositories of dataset/images files (if applicable).

the following topics have been covered in class:

* Supervised Learning
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Linear Regression
  * Logistic Regression
  * Perceptron
  * Multilayer Neural Network
  * Decision Tree
  * Ensemble Learning and Random Forest
* Unsupervised Learning
  * Principal Component Analysis and K-Means
* Optimization methods
  * Gradient Descent
