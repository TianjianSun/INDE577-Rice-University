This repository represents the implementation and applications of Gradient Descent. 

## File descriptions
"Gradient Descent.ipynb" contains the describtion and hard coding of Gradient Descent for Linear Regression algorithm, and it's applied on two regression problems.

* Applications on data sets
    * Toys data in class
    * Ethereum (ETH) price data

## Dataset used in applications

* Toys data in class

The toy data is four (x, y) points we created in class to check if gradient descent worked well.

* Ethereum (ETH) price data

The Ethereum (ETH) price data is gathered from *Yahoo Finance* using *pandas_datareader*, a commonly used and classic finance website. It contains high,	low,	open,	close,	volume and	adjusted close price of ETH.
