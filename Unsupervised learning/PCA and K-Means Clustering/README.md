# K-Means Clustering

This repository represents the implementation and applications of k-means clustering. 

## File descriptions
"K_Means Clustering.ipynb" contains the describtion and coding of k-means algorithm, then it's applied on *iris* and *wine* data set.

## Dataset used in applications
Both of the *iris* and *wine* dataset is loaded from *sklearn.datasets*.

* *iris* dataset

*iris* dataset is perhaps the best known database to be found in the pattern recognition literature. Fisher's paper is a classic in the field and is referenced frequently to this day. 

*iris* data sets consists of 3 different types of irisesâ€™ (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) petal and sepal length, stored in a 150x4 numpy.ndarray, and the rows being the samples and the columns being: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length and Petal Width.

* *wine* dataset 

The *wine* dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 3 classes of target labels, each label has samples of 59, 71, 48, and the total sample size is 178 without any missing value. 

There're 13 features and there're all numeric, real, and positive. These features are Alcohol Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines and Proline.
