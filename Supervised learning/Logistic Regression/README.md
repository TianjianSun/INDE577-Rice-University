## Dataset used in applications

The *wine* dataset is loaded from *sklearn.datasets*.
* *wine* dataset 

The *wine* dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 3 classes of target labels, each label has samples of 59, 71, 48, and the total sample size is 178 without any missing value.
