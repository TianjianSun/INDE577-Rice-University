## Dataset used in applications
The *wine* dataset is loaded from *sklearn.datasets*.
* *wine* dataset 

The *wine* dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 3 classes of target labels, each label has samples of 59, 71, 48, and the total sample size is 178 without any missing value. 

There're 13 features and there're all numeric, real, and positive. These features are Alcohol Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines and Proline.

## Dataset used in applications
* *Fashion MNIST* data set

The [*Fashion MNIST* data set](https://keras.io/api/datasets/fashion_mnist/) (from keras) is a wide-used multi-class image classification dataset. The dataset has 60,000 training data with 28x28 grayscale images and 10,000 test images. Images are labeled over 10 categories. The pixel depth allows 255 different intensities, with 0 being black and 255 being white. And the classes are: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot with labels 0 to 9 respectively.
