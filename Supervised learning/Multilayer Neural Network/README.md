## Dataset used in applications
The *wine* dataset is loaded from *sklearn.datasets*.
* *wine* dataset 

The *wine* dataset is a classic and very easy multi-class classification dataset. It has 3 classes of target labels, each label has samples of 59, 71, 48, and the total sample size is 178 without any missing value. 

There're 13 features and there're all numeric, real, and positive. These features are Alcohol Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines and Proline.
