# Linear Regreesion

This repository represents the implementation and applications of Linear Regreesion (LR). 

## File descriptions
"Linear Regression.ipynb" contains the describtion and my hard coding of LR algorithm, the evaluation of LR model, then it's applied on two regression problems.

    * Ethereum (ETH) price data
    * Diabetes data

## Dataset used in applications

* Ethereum (ETH) price data

The Ethereum (ETH) price data is gathered from *Yahoo Finance* using *pandas_datareader*, a commonly used and classic finance website. It contains high,	low,	open,	close,	volume and	adjusted close price of ETH.

* Diabetes data

The *Diabetes* dataset is loaded from *sklearn.datasets*. The Diabetes data contains ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each of n = 442 diabetes patients, as well as the response of interest, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.
